(_Last updated in 11/19/2022_)
# Downloading Terminal
![Get Terminal](a0HB9SY9O-Get Terminal)
1. Open up the Microsoft store
2. Got to the search bar at the top of the screen.
3. Search: `Windows Terminal`
---
#### A new window will appear with the search results.
1. Go to the results
2. Look for **"Windows Terminal**" by Microsoft Corporation
      - Click the one that is shown in the GIF above.
      - Click the one without the blue box on it.
3. Once you click the right one
4. It will take you to a new page.
5. On this page there will be a blue button that says "**Install**".
      - On the GIF, it says "**Open**" for me as I already have it installed.

6. "Terminal" should now be installed! :)

# Running the Optimization Script
![LaunchTerminalAndApp](T8GrJ1DdL-LaunchTerminalAndApp)
1. Open Terminal in your preferred method. Whichever method you use please run it is "administrator".
    - Ways to run "Terminal".
      1. Hit your `⊞ Win` key on your keyboard, then type "**Terminal**".
            - Right click the search result that says "**Terminal**".
            - Click "**Run as Administrato**r".
      2. Click the Windows button generally located at the bottom left of your screen and type "**Terminal**".
            - Right click the search result that says "**Terminal**".
            - Click "**Run as Administrator**".
      3. If you have another preferred method you can use that.   
---
1. Once you do the above steps in using whichever method you prefer, a new window will pop up that looks similar to:![Terminal](FRCTjfGjo-Terminal)
(Mine may look a little different due to some personal customizations.)
2. Copy this code:
      - `iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex`   
3. After that code is copied, click back into that new Terminal window.
4. Right click anywhere in the window to paste.
![PastingCode](GfMRNzzbR-PastingCode)
5. After it is pasted, just press your "**Enter**" key on your keyboard to execute the command/code.
---
Once this is done a new window will appear:
![NewWindowLaunching](_-Tjp1wbp-NewWindowLaunching)
6. In this new window it is a fairly basic UI, but I will write down the basic steps!   
7. Each tab is dedicated to doing something different, we will go from left to right of the tabs.
  - ##### Install Tab
    - This tab is for installing the basic program that you want on a new system or your current one. It can also be used to update any of the programs that you have installed from there. Once you have the apps selected that you want, click "**Start Install**"
  - ##### Tweaks Tab
    - There are a lot of options here, but if you do not know what you are doing just use the "**Recommended Selections:**" at the top of the screen.
    ![TweaksTab](TMu8Dvv5I-TweaksTab)
    - Under "**Dark Theme**" located near the bottom right, click "**Enable**".
    - Under **"Performance Plans**" located near the bottom right, click "**Add Ultimate Performance Profile**".
    - Keep "**DNS**" as "**Defaul**t"
    - Optional: Under "**Misc Tweaks**" check the box next to "**Remove Cortana**"(Only do this if you know what it impacts)
    - Once all of this is done, click "Run Tweaks"
  - ##### Config Tab
    - In this tab it gives some more advanced things to install, if you do not know what the options are on the left do not worry about them!
    - The "**System Corruption Scan**" is a nice option but we will not be going over that right now.
    - On the right, these are basically shortcuts to access other Windows option settings. I would go through these and see if there is anything you need to change.
  - ##### Updates Tab
    - In short this tab is just talking about how windows will handle and updates it gets.
    - If you have some general knowledge about windows and you are aware of browser safety and not installing virus, you can go with the "**Security Settings**" option. But, if you are not sure to the question above and just want to be safer and have the newest updates, go with the "**Default Settings**" option.
    
8. That is all for the Script! Once you have gone through everything it is smart to restart your computer. :)

## Additional Optimization Options
We are going to go through some additional options to further optimize your windows! You can continue with these or if you are happy with just running the script then thank you for your time :)! But, for those who want to do a few more tweaks then I am here for you!

### Apps Settings:
![Going To Apps](H77pNYgwU-Going To Apps)
1. Click the windows key on the bottom of your screen or the `⊞ Win` on your keyboard.
2. Type "**Settings**" which will open a new window.
3. In this new window click on the button labeled "**Apps**".
4. In this window, go through the apps there and uninstall anything that you do not want or use.
      - To uninstall an app, just click the app and 2 options will appear that says "**Modify**" & "**Uninstall**"
      - Some apps can not be uninstalled so do not worry about those.  
       
### Removing Apps from start menu
These next few steps are personal preference so it is optional for you!

1. Since you removed some of the apps, your start menu (When you click the windows icon or when you click your windows key, the window that pops up is called your "**Start Menu**".) will be slightly messed up from some blank spaces
2. When you are in your start menu, right click the categories or all the apps on the right side (I forgot the name of the categories since I do not have mine.) and click on "remove".![GetRidOfAppsOnRIght](4JNnoSUmN-GetRidOfAppsOnRIght)
3. After, your start menu should be a lot slimmer and sleeker than it was before! If it is not, make sure to just re-open the start menu.

### Disabling Startup Apps
This section is just to remove apps that startup when your computer starts up.
1. Go into your task manager
      - Right click your windows icon and click "**Task Manager**"
2. When it opens go to the "**Startup**" tab
![StartupApps](-xe-gKSVn-StartupApps)
3. Go through the apps here, and any that you do not need to startup right away when you start your computer. Right click it and click on "**Disable**" (If you do not know what the app is, just leave it alone).
4. All done, now restart your computer and things should feel a lot more smooth and faster than before.

This is all for Optimizing your windows using scripts and going through settings, hopefully this helped you out and made your system feel a lot better. This is the first time I have made a guide so I will continue to fix and add stuff as needed!

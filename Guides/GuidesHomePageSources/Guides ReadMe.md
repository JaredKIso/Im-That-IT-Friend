# Guides ReadMe

# Welcome to the guides section!

Welcome to the library where all the guides are going to be located! This is going to be where I constantly update and add guides!

Currently the folder name is what the goal of the guide is. In each folder there will more than likely (**not always**) have a few folders in it for resources for the Readme so you do not worry about that. If I have a folder you need to go into then I will mention it in the guide!

Do not forget to make an issue if there are any problems or recommendation you want me to make a guide on in the issues section! Take your time and have fun, you got this :).

Just do not forget...

It may cause us pain at first but we will strive being "The I.T. Friend"!

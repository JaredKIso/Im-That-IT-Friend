**Does this granny relate to you?**   
**Have you ever been asked for help by a friend of yours because their computer "doesn't work"?**

If so then you are in the right place! This repository is becoming a place with basic to semi-advanced tech support guides.

## Reasoning To The Creation Of This
I have been in IT all of my life so far, even though it is a fairly short one. I made the mistake like many of us tech savvy IT people have made...which is telling our family and friend "We are in IT" or "We know computers". 

Because of this detrimental mistake, I have become the tech person in my friend group and in my family. This is not even just my house hold family, it ranges to my full bloodline it feels like sometimes. 

Do not get me wrong, we care and love for our friends and family and want to help them out. But after a certain amount of time helping people out and sitting there as they do not know how to get to the "Settings" window and you are just like...

That is what this repository is for!

## The Goals
The goals of this repository is fairly simple in theory. It is made for those people who are the "IT Friend" in their friend groups. This is a place and a way for you to find simple guides from basic to semi advanced tech support solutions!    

**Ranging from:**
  - How to remove apps
  - Disable apps that startup when you first login.
  - Optimize windows
  - Remove spyware
  - Setup restore points
  - etc...

My goal is to be able to write these guides out in a "Explain to me like I am five" type of way. A way for not the most tech savvy people to understand and follow along with. Ideally this is where if someone asks you "How to remove an app" instead of possibly having to go through a painful process, you can just link them to that guide from here and prevent yourself from going...

when you are trying to help them.

## The Future
For the future of this repository, it is going to be an ongoing project that will slowly build up a library overtime. I will try to make more broad ones but as I get asked certain question from my friend group, or when I get a requested guide I will add more to this!

### Working on:
In this quick little section I will be explaining what I am working and I will try to keep it updated.   

**Currently working on:**

  - Windows 10 Optimizations âœ”
  - Customizing windows
  - Making restore points
  - How to fresh install properly
  - Scan for viruses
  - Using a script to recover Windows rather than wiping
  - Basic Internet Safety
  - Basic App stuff:
    - Setting up Discord
    - Disabling random audio sources
  - Some more advanced and random stuff:
    - Overclocking your CPU through BIOS (simple way)
    - Setting up mouse accel the proper way

Of course there will be more, but for now these are what I am working on. Stay tuned, since this is on going this will slowly build, change and update.

## Who am I?
After reading all of this you may be asking yourself, who is this guy and why should I trust him with this tech support and trust he will not mess my friends over.

Well, let me introduce myself!

### My name is Jared!
When I was younger my Dad introduced me to computer games and gave me his old dinosaur of a system. We played a ton of games on it at the time, but as graphics improves and my hardware in that system started to age it affected what we could play and the performance! I was 8 years old at that time and from that age I worked on optimizing my PC to get the best I could squeeze out of it while not destroying the lifetime of the components.

Let me say this, I do not claim to ***know*** everything or how to fix everything. But what I do know is how to do diligent research and I got really good at problem solving from a young age. During this time of optimizing my PC, and slowly growing up on tech I have become the "IT" person in the family. This has given me a lot of experience with problem solving issues I would have never thought to have had to deal with.

The people I start to support was my friends, my family members, even my Dad. Let me tell you, when you start to IT support the person who got you into IT...

Other than that, I graduated in Cyber Security, worked at google, and currently work for Azure Cloud as API support. So I have quite the broad experience in IT!

Well that is a short introduction of me, hopefully you enjoy and now see where my knowledge comes from and I look forward to my experience making these guides as I will strive to constantly improve them and broaden my knowledge!

## Misc Info
Now that you know about what this is about and more about me, I am not perfect and I do plenty of research into issues that I or my friend/family runs into. But because of this, if there is anything wrong, broken, or not specified enough in any of the guides then please do not feel afraid to let me know! You can submit an issue and I will review it and fix the guides if I see it applicable.

As well as since I am using a lot of references and tools, I will always try to leave the resources I used at the bottom of the guides. This way you can check the code and or the resources to make sure it is secure and something that you may actually want to have you friends use.

## Fin.
Thank you for your time in reading this, and hopefully this library becomes the bat in this gif for you.

Also if it still works, please feel free to share to your other IT friends! Trying to make this a positive community who just want to help people learn more about tech and enjoy helping others :). 

**Take care all, and have a great rest of your day/night!**
